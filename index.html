                    <p>Recent Virginia Tech graduate and student-athlete with 3+ years of management and sales experience with ambition to develop in the tech industry. Welcome to the <strong>JOURNEY!</strong> I have always been very curious and enthusiastic about technology and have finally begun my deep dive into the industry. 
        
                    </p>
        
                    <p>Playing football at Virginia Tech has greatly prepared me for this creative adventure as competing in a highly competitive sport that demands attention to detail and copious amounts of critical thinking crosses over nicely into tech. Outside of sports I my interests include movies, books, and podcasts. 
                    
                    </p>
        
                    <p>I passionately envision being part of a team that helps to create a revolutionary product and/or business. Although the idea has not been thought of yet, I can promise it is coming! If you would like to see examples of programs that I have created just take a scroll through the <em>PORTFOLIO</em> page!
